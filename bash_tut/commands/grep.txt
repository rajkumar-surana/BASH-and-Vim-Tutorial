-C 4 , 4line context around our match
in grep ./ dont work ./* works for to search it every file.

for searhing all txt file ./*.txt
but this command will not searh subdiretory.

this require recursive search -r
grep -winr "raj" {./, .}

what files contain a match grep -wirl "raj" . it list files where match is

if we want to count match in each file use -wirc

grep "...-...-...." names.txt  . any character
grep  -P "\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}" names.txt
